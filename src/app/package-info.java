// Placeholder for the new app package directory
// This tool call is to ensure the directory actions/app exists if it doesn't
// Actual file moving will be handled by subsequent calls or assumed to be done by the IDE/user
// For the purpose of this automated interaction, we'll proceed as if files are moved,
// and then update their package declarations and imports.
